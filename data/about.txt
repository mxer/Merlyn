My name is Merlyn. That's spelt with a 'y' so don't confuse me with that ancient bearded Welsh wizard! I'm a modern Welsh wizard that helps you operate your computer without using the keyboard and mouse (mostly). Just speak your commands! I have a limited vocabulary of about 400 commands and for now you need to use them exactly without any fluff words. The first one you need to know is Merlyn so that I listen to you. Then you can give me another command after which you have to say Merlyn again before your next command unless you told me to keep listening. The next most useful commands are 'help' and 'show general commands'. You can replace 'general' with 'keyboard', 'editing' and 'websites'. It's also very useful to know that you can say 'mouse left'( or 'right' or 'up' or 'down' followed by a number of pixels, and 'click here' I'm Free Open Source Software available under some licence, written in Python 3 by Alan Richmond. Like most Free Open Source Software I depend on the hard work of many other people. Most notably Python, Carnegie Mellon University PocketSphinx and Linux. I hope that ports to other operating systems might happen with the community help. I also hope the community might contribute with well-commented code improvements and command files.
