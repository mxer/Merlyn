Say 'Merlyn' to make him/her listen.
Merlyn will obey the next command. If that is 'keep listening' then
Merlyn will continue to obey commands until you say 'stop listening'.

Commands are grouped into the following:

	General		:	further subdivided into smaller groups
	Keyboard & mouse:	keys that Merlyn can press for you, and mouse movements
	Browsers & websites:	Controls for Google Chrome and Firefox, and some websites
	Editing		:	Vi commands

View them by saying 'show general', 'show keyboard', 'show browsers', 'show editing'.
Go further down or back up with 'page down' or 'page up'.

If Merlyn hears words you didn't say, your microphone may be picking
up background noise, or hearing what it has just spoken itself.
In the first case, try adjusting the microphone sensitivity or 
placing it closer to your mouth. In the second case, try turning down 
your speaker volume or using headphones.
